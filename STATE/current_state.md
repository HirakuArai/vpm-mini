short_goal: Complete P5-5 Consumer Injection and advance to P5-6 Observability

## Phase Progress
- **P1** (Foundation): ✅ GREEN  
- **P2** (Chaos Engineering): ✅ GREEN
- **P3** (Advanced Chaos): ✅ GREEN  
- **P4** (GitOps + ArgoCD): ✅ GREEN
- **P5** (Scaling & Migration): 🟡 IN_PROGRESS

## P5 Sub-phases
- **P5-1** (Autoscaling PoC): ✅ GREEN
- **P5-2** (Minimal UI): ✅ GREEN  ← 🆕 UPDATED
- **P5-3** (Compose→Knative): ✅ GREEN
- **P5-4** (Secrets with Vault): ✅ GREEN  ← 🆕 UPDATED  
- **P5-5** (Consumer Injection): ⏳ NEXT
- **P5-6** (Observability Line): ⏳ PENDING

## Current Focus: P5-5 Consumer Injection
**Goal**: secretKeyRef integration with Vault-synced secrets
- Move from ExternalSecret demo to real consumer workloads
- Inject vault-synced secrets into KServices via secretKeyRef
- Evidence: secret consumption in running pods

## Evidence Reports
- P5-2 UI: reports/ui_manual_evidence_20250916_153047.md
- P5-4 Vault: reports/p5_4_secrets_vault_verify_20250916_171916.md

## exit_criteria
- P5-5 Consumer Injection completed with evidence
- Secret consumption verified in running pods
- KService secretKeyRef integration tested
- P5-6 Observability Line ready for execution

## 優先タスク
- Consumer workload selection: Identify which service needs secrets
- Secret preparation: Create production secret in Vault (API keys, DB credentials)
- KService injection: Add secretKeyRef to selected service
- End-to-end test: Verify secret available in pod environment
- Evidence collection: Document consumption via pod exec
