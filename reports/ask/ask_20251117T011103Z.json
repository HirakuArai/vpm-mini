This likely indicates a reachability, Host header, TLS, or auth/config mismatch from that vantage point rather than the SLI logic itself. It is acceptable as a baseline snapshot, but we should quickly verify exact status classes and correct the probe target/headers/auth or run the probe from inside the cluster.",
