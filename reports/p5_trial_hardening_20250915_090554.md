# Evidence: Trial hardening (digest pin + daily capture + script rename)
- digest pinned for all services (6/6 services now use @sha256: digests)
- tools/vpm_daily_capture.sh added (automated evidence collection)
- vmp_trial_status.sh -> vpm_trial_status.sh renamed (consistent naming)
- AlertmanagerConfig wired to am-slack-receiver secret (alerts â†’ Slack)
