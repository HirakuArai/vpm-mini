# Evidence: SLO smoke verification (20250915_103359)

## Rules
- Loaded alerts (state は Prom 側の管理状態): `reports/slo_rules_20250915_103359.json`
- **Status**: 0 SLO rules found in Prometheus
- **Issue**: PrometheusRules exist in cluster but not loaded by Prometheus
- **Fixed**: Corrected label from 'vmp-' to 'vpm-mini-kube-prometheus-stack'

## Targets
- Focus services の targets/health: `reports/slo_targets_20250915_103359.json`
- **Status**: 0 service targets found
- **KServices**: All 6 services (hello-ai, watcher, curator, planner, synthesizer, archivist) are READY=True
- **Issue**: ServiceMonitor configuration may need investigation

## Notes
- 本手順は **発火させない** 静的検証。しきい値の稼働テストは別途 runbook に沿って実施。
- Configuration fix applied (label correction) may require time to propagate
- Follow-up needed: Verify Prometheus operator rule/target discovery
