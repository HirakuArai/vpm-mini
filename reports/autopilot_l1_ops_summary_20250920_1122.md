# Autopilot L1 Ops Summary

**Generated**: 2025-09-20 11:22:00
**Purpose**: Execute Autopilot L1 dry-run → live workflow with artifacts and summary

## Configuration
- **Project**: vpm-mini
- **Max Lines**: 3
- **Target**: Dry-run first, then live execution if successful

## Execution Results

### Dry-Run Attempts
- **Run 1**: 17873938108 - FAILED (workflow file issue - `if` condition blocking workflow_call)
- **Run 2**: 17873975371 - FAILED (same issue, before fix)
- **Run 3**: 17874017913 - FAILED (after partial fix, during merge conflict)
- **Run 4**: 17874032429 - FAILED (workflow file syntax issue persists)

### Root Cause Analysis
The Autopilot L1 Manual Shim workflow consistently fails with "workflow file issue" because:

1. **Original Issue**: Main workflow had `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` which blocked workflow_call execution
2. **Partial Fix Applied**: Updated to `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.event_name == 'workflow_call'` via PR #285
3. **Remaining Issue**: The workflows appear to have a configuration issue causing immediate failure

### Artifacts Status
- **Dry-run artifacts**: None (all runs failed before job execution)
- **Live artifacts**: N/A (dry-run never succeeded)
- **PR creation**: N/A (no successful execution to trigger PR)

## Error Pattern
All runs show the same pattern:
```
X This run likely failed because of a workflow file issue.
HTTP 404: Not Found - artifacts not available
```

## Runner Logs
```txt
(no stdout available - runs failed before execution)
```

## Identified Issues

### 1. Workflow File Structure
The manual shim workflow calls the main workflow but may have syntax or reference issues.

### 2. Permission Context
workflow_call may need different permission context than workflow_dispatch.

### 3. GitHub Cache Issues
Workflow definitions might be cached and not reflecting recent changes.

## Minimal Patch Required

Based on the failure pattern, the minimal patch needed is to debug the workflow syntax. Here's the recommended investigation:

### Option A: Test Debug Workflow
```bash
# Try the debug workflow which has simpler structure
gh workflow run autopilot_l1_debug.yml -r main \
  -f project=vpm-mini -f dry_run=true -f max_lines=3
```

### Option B: Simplify Manual Shim
The manual shim may need job-level defaults:
```yaml
jobs:
  call-l1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04  # Add explicit runner
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      actions: read
    uses: ./.github/workflows/autopilot_l1.yml
```

### Option C: Check Workflow Call Syntax
Verify the workflow_call inputs match exactly:
```yaml
# In main workflow workflow_call section
inputs:
  project:
    required: false
    type: string
    default: 'vpm-mini'
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Debug
Test the autopilot_l1_debug.yml workflow to verify the issue is specific to the manual shim pattern.

### 2. Workflow Syntax Validation
Use GitHub's workflow validation or local yamllint to check syntax.

### 3. Simplified Test
Create a minimal workflow_call test to isolate the issue.

- **Debug Documentation**: reports/actions_autopilot_l1_debug_workflow_20250920_1031.md

## Exit Criteria Status
❌ **Dry-run success**: Failed (workflow syntax issue)
❌ **Artifacts with logs**: No artifacts generated (pre-execution failure)
❌ **Live execution**: N/A (prerequisite failed)
❌ **PR creation**: N/A (no successful execution)

## Conclusion
The Autopilot L1 system requires a minimal patch to resolve workflow file syntax issues. The core infrastructure (debug workflow, main workflow logic, manual shim pattern) is in place, but there's a configuration issue preventing execution.

**Immediate Action**: Test the debug workflow to isolate whether the issue is specific to the workflow_call pattern or affects all Autopilot L1 workflows.

**Status**: Investigation required - workflow syntax issue blocking all execution
**Next**: Test debug workflow or apply minimal workflow_call syntax patch
