# Phase Guard Conflict Resolve Evidence

- target_branch: chore/guard-phase-2-fix-ci
- files_resolved:
  - Makefile (state-view + phase-guard 統合, PROJECT 変数対応)
  - STATE/vpm-mini/current_state.md (phase/context_header を Phase 2 に統一)

## Commands
- make phase-guard PROJECT=vpm-mini → **PASS**
- make state-view  PROJECT=vpm-mini → **PASS**（reports/vpm-mini/state_view_*.md 生成）

## Verification Output

### Phase Guard Pass
```
[phase-guard] checking: STATE/vpm-mini/current_state.md
[phase-guard] allowed phases: ['Phase 2']
[phase-guard] detected phase: 'Phase 2'
[phase-guard] ✅ Phase validation passed: 'Phase 2'
[phase-guard] File: STATE/vpm-mini/current_state.md
```

### State View Generation
```
[state-view] reading: STATE/vpm-mini/current_state.md
[extract] phase: Phase 2
[extract] context_header: "repo=vpm-mini / branch=main / phase=Phase 2"
[state-view] written: reports/vpm-mini/state_view_20250919_1613.md
```

## Merge Resolution Details

### Makefile
- Unified state-view and phase-guard targets
- Added PYTHON variable for flexibility
- PHASE_ALLOWED="Phase 2" explicit in phase-guard target
- Both targets use PROJECT variable consistently

### STATE/vpm-mini/current_state.md
- phase: Phase 2 (removed inline comment that caused validation failure)
- context_header: "repo=vpm-mini / branch=main / phase=Phase 2"
- Added Phase 2 specific exit_criteria
- Updated 優先タスク to match Phase 2 objectives

## Status: ✅ Ready for Auto-merge
