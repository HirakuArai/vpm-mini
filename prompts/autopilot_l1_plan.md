# Autopilot L1 - Limited Autonomous Loop Plan

## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: Implement a limited autonomous loop system that can safely handle low-risk, high-value improvements without human intervention while maintaining strict safety constraints and audit trails.

**Scope**: Documentation updates, comment improvements, code formatting fixes within predefined allowlists and change limits.

**Safety Philosophy**: Fail-safe design with multiple constraints, comprehensive logging, and human oversight requirements.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/autopilot_l1.yml`)
   - Triggered manually or on schedule
   - Runs scan and applies changes within limits
   - Creates PR with auto-merge enabled
   - Generates comprehensive audit trail

2. **Autopilot Script** (`scripts/autopilot_l1.sh`)
   - Scans codebase for improvement opportunities
   - Applies changes within safety constraints
   - Generates structured output for tracking

3. **Policy Documentation** (`docs/autopilot_l1_policy.md`)
   - Safety constraints and allowlists
   - Operational procedures
   - Emergency stop procedures

4. **Plan Documentation** (`prompts/autopilot_l1_plan.md`)
   - System design and architecture
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Success criteria

## Safety Constraints

### Change Limits
- **Maximum Changes**: 3 per execution (configurable)
- **Target Areas**: Only docs, comments, formatting (configurable)
- **File Allowlists**: Strict pattern matching for allowed file types
- **No Functional Changes**: Zero modifications to business logic

### Operational Constraints
- **Dry Run Default**: All executions default to dry-run mode
- **Human Review**: PR creation requires human approval for merge
- **Audit Trail**: Every change logged with timestamp and reasoning
- **Emergency Stop**: Manual workflow cancellation available

### Technical Constraints
- **Branch Protection**: Only operates on main branch
- **Permission Limits**: Minimal required GitHub permissions
- **Timeout Protection**: Workflow timeout prevents runaway execution
- **Rate Limiting**: Schedule constraints prevent excessive execution

## Target Areas

### 1. Documentation (`docs`)
**Allowlist**: `*.md`, `docs/**`, `README*`, `CHANGELOG*`, `LICENSE*`

**Improvements**:
- Add missing README titles
- Convert TODO comments to proper TODO sections
- Fix markdown formatting issues
- Update outdated documentation links

**Safety**: Read-only scanning, text-only changes, no structural modifications

### 2. Comments (`comments`)
**Allowlist**: `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `*.sh`

**Improvements**:
- Add missing function docstrings
- Add script purpose comments
- Convert inline TODOs to structured format
- Improve comment clarity and formatting

**Safety**: Comment-only changes, no code logic modifications

### 3. Formatting (`formatting`)
**Allowlist**: `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`

**Improvements**:
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Fix inconsistent indentation
- Convert tabs to spaces in YAML files
- Normalize line endings

**Safety**: Whitespace-only changes, no syntax modifications

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow implementation
- [x] Autopilot scan script with safety constraints
- [x] Policy and plan documentation
- [x] Initial testing framework

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing
- [ ] Dry-run execution on real codebase
- [ ] Validate safety constraints work correctly
- [ ] Test PR creation and DoD compliance
- [ ] Verify audit trail completeness

### Phase 3: Limited Deployment
- [ ] Manual trigger testing
- [ ] Monitor PR quality and merge success
- [ ] Gather feedback on change quality
- [ ] Refine target area definitions

### Phase 4: Scheduled Execution (Future)
- [ ] Enable scheduled runs (currently disabled)
- [ ] Monitor autonomous operation
- [ ] Expand allowlists based on evidence
- [ ] Consider L2 autonomous features

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- âœ… Zero functional code changes ever applied
- âœ… All changes within predefined allowlists
- âœ… Change limits never exceeded
- âœ… Complete audit trail for every execution

### Operational Success
- ðŸŽ¯ 90%+ PR merge rate without human intervention
- ðŸŽ¯ Zero production issues from autopilot changes
- ðŸŽ¯ Positive developer feedback on change quality
- ðŸŽ¯ Reduced manual maintenance overhead

### Safety Success
- ðŸ”’ No security issues introduced
- ðŸ”’ No breaking changes ever created
- ðŸ”’ Emergency stop procedures work correctly
- ðŸ”’ All constraints respected 100% of time

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Execution Metrics
- **Changes Per Run**: Track against limits
- **Target Area Distribution**: Monitor area usage
- **Success Rate**: PR creation and merge rates
- **Time to Merge**: Measure automation efficiency

### Quality Metrics
- **Change Accuracy**: Manual review of applied changes
- **False Positive Rate**: Changes that needed reversion
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Feedback on change quality
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Time saved vs. overhead

### Safety Metrics
- **Constraint Violations**: Must remain at zero
- **Emergency Stops**: Track frequency and reasons
- **Manual Interventions**: Monitor human override needs
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: Verify logging coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Runaway Changes**: Multiple change limits and timeouts
- **Scope Creep**: Strict allowlists and pattern matching
- **Broken Builds**: Comprehensive CI/CD integration
- **Data Loss**: Git-based versioning and backup

### Operational Risks
- **Over-automation**: Human review requirement maintained
- **Quality Degradation**: Continuous monitoring and feedback
- **Emergency Situations**: Manual override and stop procedures
- **Team Resistance**: Gradual rollout with clear benefits

### Security Risks
- **Privilege Escalation**: Minimal required permissions
- **Code Injection**: Text-only, non-executable changes
- **Access Control**: GitHub permissions and branch protection
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging and tracking

## Extension Roadmap

### L2 Features (Future Consideration)
- Dependency updates within semantic version constraints
- Test file generation for uncovered functions
- Configuration file consistency checks
- Dead code detection and flagging

### L3 Features (Advanced Future)
- Simple bug pattern detection and fixing
- Code style enforcement across entire codebase
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Security vulnerability patching

### Integration Features
- Slack/Teams notifications for autopilot activities
- Dashboard for monitoring autopilot metrics
- Integration with existing code review tools
- Custom rule engine for organization-specific improvements

## Conclusion

The Autopilot L1 system provides a safe, constrained approach to autonomous code improvements. By focusing on low-risk, high-value changes with comprehensive safety measures, it reduces manual maintenance overhead while maintaining code quality and security.

The success of L1 will inform future expansions while establishing patterns for safe autonomous development operations.
